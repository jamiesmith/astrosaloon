The next step in choosing the pieces of the imaging rig was the telescope itself.  

Trying to follow the advice of the masses, my requirements for the 'scope were:

> Small(ish) refractor, preferably apochromatic, either with a flat field, or a flattener available.  Bonus points if the system allows threaded (vs compression) connections in the imaging train.

<!--more-->

The "small(ish)" aspect generally refers to a refractor which is around 80mm, which is about 3". These refractors tend to have an f-ratio between f/5 and f/7.5, giving focal lengths in the neighborhood of 400mm to 600mm. _Apochromatic_ refers to the [design of the the telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apochromat), and is geared for better correction of chromatic abberation (color fringing).   The "bonus" part isn't normally included in the recommendation - but if you try to make this happen I think that you will save yourself a good deal of headache later on-- minizing flexure in your imaging train up front will remove at least one headache later.  

I also wanted solid, automated focusing.  My past couple of 'scopes had very troublesome focusers, though I had upgraded the focuser on the CPC to a [Feather Touch](http://starlightinstruments.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=244) which did make a *huge* difference-- the dual-speed focuser give you much finer control.  Automation, especially when using a mono camera, saves even more grief.

# The 'Scope Choices

Here is a quick matrix of some specs for _some_ of the scopes I looked at- I can't find the original matrix, so going off of ones that I am **sure** were on it.

| Manufacturer | Scope                                                                                                                              | Aperture | Focal Length | f-ratio | Price |Note      |

**Note**: Some 'scopes come in various configurations, so I included the price of the variation I was looking at, along with a link to find out more.
{: .notice--primary}

There were a few other brands that I looked at - things like Williams Optics, the Orion EON.  

One of the biggest issues with these telescopes was, and still is, _availability_.  The SVS130 is at the top of that list for a reason -- if it had been in stock (or had Vic been able to point at a reasonable timeframe) I would have gone with that.  It comes with a high-precision, absolute focuser.  While the _aperture_ was far away from the target of 80mm, the _focal length_ is short enough to not be comparing to RCs or SCTs.  

It was really that way for most of the Stellarvues.  "Ooh, sorry, you just missed it!"  I kept checking in as I researched, but to no avail-- and I had no desire to be placed on an indeterminate waitlist.  

I had always heard about Tak's.  The build quality, the _optical_ quality, the scarcity.

As I am deciding, ready to really pull the trigger- funds in hand, I check on OPTCorp's site.  `In Stock`.  So I nabbed the FSQ-106EDXv4, and have had no regrets.  Some obligitory unboxing pics are below (if there are no pictures, it didn't happen).  So I was able to get a _fantastic_ scope, and got it within a week of ordering.  It would be quite some time before I could actually **do** anything with it.

The Tak has a HUGE image circle, and a mediocre focuser.  It looks very nice in my glass-door office cabinet, which is its new home.  I replaced it with a mac-daddy NiteCrawler 3.5 from [MoonLite](https://focuser.com).

## Takahashi Reducer QE 0.73x

This actually ended up going back.  

1. It was _not_ cheap (not that the other stuff was)
2. I couldn't get definitive spacing on how to use it with the NiteCrawler
3. I already had enough to learn
4. I will have plenty of targets without it :wink:

I am including a few shots of it anyway- it really shows the _quality_ of Tak equipment!
