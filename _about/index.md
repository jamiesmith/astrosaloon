I guess that no personal blog site would be complete without a completely self-serving section on the author.  I know that you have been waiting, so __here it is__!

Hi, my name is Jamie Smith.  I have a long history in software consulting and sales.  One of my greatest skills is what I call *the art of efficiency*.  This isn't some self-help book topic, with 47 steps to greatness.  More along the lines of enhanced laziness. With this process I get things done as efficiently as humanly possible.  Do something once?  OK, fine.  Twice?  Take notes and make it repeatable.  Three or more times?  Write a script.

This ethos really seeps its way into all aspects of work - I plan to capture some of the notes into docs for this site, hoping that someone will get some use out of them.  Worst case, I reclaim a few KB on my Dropbox account.

I have a pretty broad experience base, ranging from credit card processing on distributed transactional platforms to container management, Docker, and IoT.  My current gig was a big departure from what I was doing at previous companies, while keeping the best parts.  This has allowed me to develop and hone the abilities that were always an undercurrent in my previous roles - conveying information and ideas.  Whether it was giving demos, standing at the whiteboard, or brainstorming around a conference table or computer screen- I *lived* talking to customers.  I spent three months in Singapore, working on a proof-of-concept project for a large consumer bank.  Every day during that period at least two hours were spent designing their architecture, deciding and defending ideas, coming to consensus with the customer.  Part of a team, yet completely autonomous.  It was both glorious and dreadful. Meet me for a beer and I will tell you the stories (but not Hoegaarden.  That was about the only decent beer available in Singapore.  Three months.  Do the math.  I will likely never drink another Hoegaarden).

Next to my laziness, another selling point is that I ~~am incredibly picky and notice every mistake I see (except my own)~~ pay attention to the details of things.  A good friend summed it up with "you see the world differently than everyone else".

I am good with that.
